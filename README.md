# CyberSec-Writeups
Cybersecurity Writeups

This repository is a collection of my cybersecurity writeups, documenting challenges and scenarios I have worked through. It includes a mix of Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges, VulnHub machines, penetration testing practice labs, and other security-related problem sets.

Contents

- CTF Challenges – Writeups from various competitions and practice platforms.

- VulnHub Machines – Step-by-step walkthroughs of vulnerable machines.

- Penetration Testing Labs – Notes and solutions from practice environments.

- Miscellaneous – Other security-related writeups and research notes.

Structure

Each writeup is organized into its own directory or file, typically containing:

- Challenge or machine name

- Description and objectives

- Detailed methodology and thought process

- Commands, scripts, or payloads used

- Explanations of vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques

- Key takeaways and lessons learned

Purpose

This repository serves two goals:

1. To track and document my own progress in cybersecurity.

2. To share knowledge and techniques that may help others learn, practice, and improve.
